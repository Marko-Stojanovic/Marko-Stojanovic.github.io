                        <span>What’s so special about the food NYHFB provides? People often grab the leftovers from their pantries and just donate that. Why should the food a client receives be expected to be any good?</span>
                        <span>Potentially unusable food donations are a definite problem for food banks. Regardless, any donation is still highly appreciated. We do make sure to stress the importance of high impact foods though, in hopes of providing higher quality hampers to clients. On top of that, our official website mainly encourages monetary donations. This is what allows us to provide clients with perishable food options that any family would expect to see at a dinner table. Picture a crisp, oven roasted chicken, potatoes, and a gorgeous leafy-green salad on the side… This is the quality food we try to provide through monetary donations, and something we’re managing to do more of, each year.</span>

                        <span>People all across Ontario are going hungry. The GTA is notoriously expensive in every regard. Why should people outside the North York catchment area even care about this food bank?</span>
                        <span>The GTA is beyond expensive; “notorious” might still be underselling it. We also understand that middle-class households have also been greatly impacted in recent years. Worst of all, food banks often require families to meet a certain standard of living, or they may be ineligible to receive services. NYHFB works by an honour system, and believes the individuals who seek help, really need help. Tons of families are struggling though, which is why we provide first-time clients with food hampers regardless of location. After that, we work extensively with the family or individual to find solutions in their catchment area, to prevent food insecurity across the GTA.</span>

                        <span>Aren’t food banks just a bandaid over a bullet wound? You can provide and provide, but food insecurity will never truly go away. Why should someone look to the NYHFB if food banks don’t matter in the long term?</span>
                        <span>Food banks are indeed like a bandaid over a bullet wound. Donations can slow food insecurity, but they’ll never truly put a stop to it. So why donate to NYHFB at all then? It’s because we use that extra bought time to help implement long-term solutions. If we can end a family’s hunger for just a day, it’s still very meaningful. By applying that bandaid though, we have more time to develop programs that get to the root of the problem. From gardens to advocacy, our approaches aren’t simply limited to multiple food spaces. Know that when you donate, you’re donating to surgically extract the bullet that’s causing food insecurity in Ontario.</span>
