                        <span>What’s so special about the food NYHFB provides? People often grab the leftovers from their pantries and just donate that. Why should the food a client receives be expected to be any good?</span>
                        <span>There is always a balance between receiving available support and providing dignified assistance. As we are asking for the community's support, we are constantly educating our prospective supporters - access to 'good' food is a right and food insecurity is a complex issue that has many contributing factors including inequality, government policies, etc. If the food is not good enough for our own consumption, why would it be good enough for a food bank client?</span>
                        <span>Furthermore, we spend tremendous amount of human and financial resources to transport/sort/discard/store/distribute food. We do that to ensure our clients get the best possible food. Since we rely primarily on donor support for our operation, we are accountable to our supporters to ensure we make the best use of our resources. Sometimes food purchase is a much better option and it's the quickest / less expensive way to get food to community members in need.</span>

                        <span>People all across Ontario are going hungry. The GTA is notoriously expensive in every regard. Why should people outside the North York catchment area even care about this food bank?</span>
                        <span>Our simple response: you don't have to care about North York Harvest, the organization/network, but please pay attention to how one can support the easing of food insecurity.

                        <span>Aren’t food banks just a bandaid over a bullet wound? You can provide and provide, but food insecurity will never truly go away. Why should someone look to the NYHFB if food banks don’t matter in the long term?</span>
                        <span>Yes, providing emergency food is not a long-term solution to food insecurity but it's still vital to the growing number of our community members. When one focuses more on long-term or short-term solution, both MUST happen simultaneously. Keep in mind that more than 20,000 individuals are being served each month through our network. It's not an 'either-or' situation. As mentioned, while our food banking services remain our bread and butter, we are also leveraging our existing infrastructure and expertise in job training program and social enterprise.</span>
                        <span>Another important point: food insecurity can only be addressed when NFP, government, the private sector and the community each play a role - policies, resources and on-the-ground implementation.</span>
