            <h3>Supporting Pre-teens and Adolescents post Covid Era (SPACE) is an organization whose motto is “Youth mental health should always be over the moon!”. We believe that increasing engagement in a local community is a great way for everyone to connect and feel better emotionally, which is why we would like to assist the city of Vaughan in particular. Our focus is on the one-third of the population that is comprised of youth, knowing how greatly they have been impacted by the pandemic.</h3>
